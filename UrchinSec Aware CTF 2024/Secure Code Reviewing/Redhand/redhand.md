# RedHand - 100 points

## Description

We were compromised, we were able to obtain and recover an artifact that is evidence which we suspect was used by the attacker to gain persistence back to the web server!

```php=
<?=`$_GET[0]`?>
```

Can you identify the vulnerability available on this artifact that allowed the threat actor to gain access to the web server.
